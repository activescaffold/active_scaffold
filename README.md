Quick Start
-----------
To get started with a new Rails project

Added to Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'active_scaffold'
```

Add jquery-rails to Gemfile, or handle jquery with other tools like webpack or importmap. Also it's possible to load jquery in your layout before application.js using CDN (e.g. jquery-rails-cdn). You can replace @rails/ujs with jquery_ujs, although @rails/ujs should work (never load both).

```ruby
gem 'jquery-rails'
```

For rails 7.x, install generator will add `active_scaffold` to `config/importmap.rb`, `app/javascript/application.js`, and `active_scaffold/manifest.js` to `app/assets/config/manifest.js`. It will add `jquery` and `jquery_ujs` to all the 3 files if jquery-rails gem is available.

For rails 6.1, install generator will create `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`, add it, and `active_scaffold/manifest.js`, to `app/assets/config/manifest.js` and add `javascript_include_tag` in the layout, as ActiveScaffold doesn't work with webpack. It will add `jquery` to `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` too if query-rails gem is available, although Jquery may be loaded by packs too and it will work, it won't add `jquery_ujs` or `@rails/ujs` as it's added to `app/javascript/packs/application.js` by default.

Run the following commands

```console
bundle install
rails g active_scaffold:install
rails db:create
rails g active_scaffold:resource Model [attrs]
rails db:migrate
```    

Run the app and visit localhost:3000/<plural_model>

It's recommended to call `clear_helpers` in ApplicationController, as some helpers defined by ActiveScaffold, such as active_scaffold_enum_options, options_for_association_conditions, association_klass_scoped, are usually overrided for different controllers, and it may cause issues when all helper modules are available to every controller, specially when models have associations or columns with the same name but need different code for those overrided helper methods.

Threadsafe
----------

Threadsafe is enabled always since 4.0, and it can't be disabled.  

Breaking Changes
----------------

When upgrading from 3.x, add `active_scaffold/manifest.js` to `app/assets/config/manifest.js` to prevent issues with assets.

Changing column settings on a request has changed, it must use `active_scaffold_config.columns.override(:name)` at least the first time. After calling `columns.override(:name)`, calling it again or calling `columns[:name]` will return the overrided column. It also supports a block. See [Per Request Configuration](https://github.com/activescaffold/active_scaffold/wiki/Per-Request-Configuration) for examples and more comprehensive explanation.

Changing columns for an action (e.g. add or exclude) on a request must use active_scaffold_config.actions.override_columns, the first time, or use assignment.

If you have a `_form_association_record` partial view overrided, use `record` local variable instead of `form_association_record`.

If you have code rendering `form_association_record` partial, then pass `record` local variable, or use `as: :record` if using render with collection key.

Configuration
-------------
See Wiki for instructions on customising ActiveScaffold and to find the full API details.
