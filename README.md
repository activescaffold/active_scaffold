ActiveScaffold provides a quick and powerful user interfaces for CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations for Rails applications. It offers additonal features including searching, pagination & layout control.  Rails >= 5.2.0 is supported, ruby >= 2.5 required.

Branch Details
--------------
3-6-stable supports rails >= 4.2.x and <= 6.1.x, and ruby >= 2.3.0

These versions are not supported anymore:  
3-5-stable supports rails >= 4.0.x and <= 5.1.x, and ruby >= 2.0.0  
3-4-stable supports rails >= 3.2.x and <= 4.2.x, and ruby >= 1.9.3  
3-3-stable supports rails 3.2.x and ruby >= 1.8  
rails-3.2 supports Rails 3.1 & 3.2, and is the current source of the 3.2.x line of gems.

Quick Start
-----------
To get started with a new Rails project

Added to Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'active_scaffold'
```

For rails >= 5.1, add jquery-rails to Gemfile, and install generator will jquery to application.js before rails-ujs. Also it's possible to load jquery in your layout before application.js using CDN (e.g. jquery-rails-cdn). You can replace rails-ujs with jquery_ujs, although rails-ujs should work (never load both).

```ruby
gem 'jquery-rails'
```

For rails >= 6.0, installer generator will create app/assets/javascripts/application.js, add it to assets.precompile array and add javascript_include_tag in layout, as ActiveScaffold doesn't work with webpack yet. Jquery may be loaded by packs or assets pipeline.

Run the following commands, for rails 4.2

```console
bundle install
rails g active_scaffold:install
bundle exec rake db:create
rails g active_scaffold:resource Model [attrs]
bundle exec rake db:migrate
```

Or run the following commands, for rails >= 5

```console
bundle install
rails g active_scaffold:install
rails db:create
rails g active_scaffold:resource Model [attrs]
rails db:migrate
```    

Run the app and visit localhost:3000/<plural_model>

Threadsafe
----------

Threadsafe can be enabled calling ActiveScaffold.threadsafe! in an initializer.
 It should be enabled on app start and it can't be disabled. Threadsafety is a
 new feature and not well tested yet.  

Configuration
-------------
See Wiki for instructions on customising ActiveScaffold and to find the full API details.
