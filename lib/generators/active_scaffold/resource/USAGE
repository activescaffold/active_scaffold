Description:
    Scaffolds an entire resource, from model and migration to controller,
        along with a full test suite and configured to use active_scaffold.
    The resource is ready to use as a starting point for your RESTful,
        resource-oriented application.

    Pass the name of the model (in singular form), either CamelCased or
        under_scored, as the first argument, and an optional list of attribute
    pairs.

    Attribute pairs are field:type arguments specifying the
    model's attributes. Timestamps are added by default, so you don't have to
    specify them by hand as 'created_at:datetime updated_at:datetime'.

    You don't have to think up every attribute up front, but it helps to
    sketch out a few so you can start working with the resource immediately.

    For example, 'active_scaffold post title:string body:text published:boolean'
    gives you a model with those three attributes, a controller configured to use active_scaffold,
    as well as a resources :posts with additional active_scaffold routes
    declaration in config/routes.rb.

    If you want to remove all the generated files, run
    'rails destroy active_scaffold ModelName'.

Examples:
    `rails generate active_scaffold:resource post`
    `rails generate active_scaffold:resource post title:string body:text published:boolean`
    `rails generate active_scaffold:resource purchase order_id:integer amount:decimal`
