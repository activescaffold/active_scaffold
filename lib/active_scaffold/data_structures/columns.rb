    # The motivation for this collection is that this Columns data structure fills two roles: it provides
    # the master list of all known columns, and it provides an inheritable list for all other actions (e.g.
    # Create and Update and List). Well we actually want to *know* about as many columns as possible, so
    # we don't want people actually removing columns from @set. But at the same time, we want to be able to
    # manage which columns get inherited. Tada!
    #
    # This collection is referenced by other parts of ActiveScaffold and by methods within this DataStructure.
    # IT IS NOT MEANT FOR PUBLIC USE (but if you know what you're doing, go ahead)
