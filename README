== Version Information

If you want to use the gem, add to your Gemfile:
  gem "active_scaffold"

In case you would like to use most recent commit:
  gem 'active_scaffold', :git => 'git://github.com/activescaffold/active_scaffold.git'

3.1.* and 3.2.* versions works with rails 3.1 and 3.2, 3.0.* versions with rails 3.0.
To use previous rails versions you will have to install the right branch as a plugin.

Active Scaffold master currently supports rails 3.1 and rails 3.2, you can use following branches for previous rails versions:
Rails 3.0.*: Active Scaffold rails-3.0
Rails 2.3.*: Active Scaffold rails-2.3 and v2.4
Rails 2.2.*: Active Scaffold rails-2.2
Rails 2.1.*: Active Scaffold rails-2.1
Rails < 2.1: Active Scaffold 1-1-stable (no guarantees)

Since Rails 2.3, render_component plugin is needed for nested and embedded scaffolds. It works with rails-2.3 branch from ewildgoose repository:
script/plugin install git://github.com/ewildgoose/render_component.git -r rails-2.3

Since Rails 3.0 render_component is not used for nesting, but is optional for embedded scaffolds.
For Rails 3.0, https://github.com/rails/verification.git is also needed, not in rails 3.1 or higher.

If you want to install as plugins under vendor/plugins, install these versions:
  rails plugin install git://github.com/vhochstein/render_component.git
  rails plugin install git://github.com/rails/verification.git
  rails plugin install git://github.com/activescaffold/active_scaffold.git -r 'rails-3.0'

== Pick your own javascript framework

The Rails 3.0 version uses unobtrusive Javascript, so you are free to pick your javascript framework.
Out of the box Prototype or JQuery are supported for rails 3.1 and later. For rails 3.0 pick a JS file:

Prototype 1.7 (default js framework)
rails.js in git://github.com/vhochstein/prototype-ujs.git

JQuery 1.4.1, 1.4.2
https://github.com/vhochstein/jquery-ujs/raw/jquery1_4_2/src/rails.js

JQuery > 1.4.2
https://github.com/vhochstein/jquery-ujs/raw/master/src/rails.js

To configure the javascript framework when installed under vendor/plugins/
uncomment last line in config/initializers/active_scaffold.rb in order to use jquery instead of prototype.
That file is created when you install ActiveScaffold as a plugin.

To configure the javascript framework when installed as a gem:
Add a config/initializers/active_scaffold.rb containing:
ActiveScaffold.js_framework = :jquery # :prototype is the default
