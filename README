== Version Information

Please note the following list of Active Scaffold branches and Rails versions. Master will not work with Rails < 2.2

Active Scaffold master currently supports rails-2.3.5, but incompatible changes can be introduced, if you want an stable version, use rails-2.3
Rails 2.3.*: Active Scaffold rails-2.3
Rails 2.2.*: Active Scaffold rails-2.2
Rails 2.1.*: Active Scaffold rails-2.1
Rails < 2.1: Active Scaffold 1-1-stable (no guarantees)

Since Rails 2.3, render_component plugin is needed for nested and embbeded scaffolds. It works with rails-2.3 branch from ewildgoose repository:
script/plugin install git://github.com/ewildgoose/render_component.git -r rails-2.3

Rails 3.0 compatible fork of activesaffold by Volker Hochstein:

Since Rails 3.0 render_component is nt used for nesting, but optional for embedded scaffolds
Rails 3.0 version of render_component:
rails plugin install git://github.com/vhochstein/render_component.git

Since Rails 3.0, the following is needed:
rails plugin install git://github.com/rails/verification.git

Fork uses unobtrusive Javascript, so you are basically free to pick your javascript framework
Out of the box Prototype or JQuery are supported:

Prototype 1.7 (default js framework)
rails.js in git://github.com/vhochstein/prototype-ujs.git

JQuery 1.4.1
rails.js in git://github.com/vhochstein/jquery-ujs.git
uncomment last line in ...plugins/active_scaffold/environment.rb in order tu use jquery instead of prototype
